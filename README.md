# How to run tests

#### `yarn install`
#### `yarn test`

### Footnote

There are few comments inside the code about what could be improved if that would be a real world implementation

### Continuous Testing

I have set up pipeline using GitHub Actions. It includes installing dependencies and running tests to ensure the reliability of the codebase.
